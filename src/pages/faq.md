      Many of the Democratic candidates are supporting a major program called
      the Green New Deal, which is designed to stop climate change while
      creating millions of jobs. This could be a great thing, but only if it
      prioritizes the leadership, issues and needs of Detroiters. That’s why our
      message is **MAKE DETROIT THE ENGINE OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL**.


      We’ll be raising up issues including water shutoffs, air pollution,
      environmental racism, emergency management and tax giveaways to
      corporations and billionaires, the need for good union jobs and worker
      power for Detroiters, and the work that’s beginning to establish a healthy
      and regenerative economy here in Detroit.
    question: What's all this about the Green New Deal?
