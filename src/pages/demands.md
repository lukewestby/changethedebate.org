  The Green New Deal (GND) resolution states that implementation must be led by communities on the frontlines of pollution, poverty, and the climate crisis. What follows is a list of the 15 key issues that Detroiters have lifted up as key to local implementation of GND. These demands are organized into three central themes: affirming our human rights, recognizing Detroit’s unique position, and emphasizing community control.
themes:
  - summary: A GND for Detroit recognizes that in the wealthiest nation on earth, we have a right to clean air, land, water, food, energy, and jobs
    demands:
      - title: Stop water shutoffs
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must establish that everyone deserves access to clean, affordable water. If in the state of Michigan we allow Nestle to take over 100 million gallons of water for just $200/year, then Detroiters and all Michiganders should have enough water to drink, cook, bathe and enjoy.
      - title: Hire locals
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must ensure that when companies locate in our community, they hire community members. Far too often, companies move to Detroit and other marginalized communities by promising jobs in exchange for tax breaks, only to hire people from out of town. If a company is unwilling to hire local community members, they should not locate in our communities.
      - title: Fix our pipes, save our water
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must take systematic and swift action to protect communities from water contamination by stopping extractive oil industries that place our water sources at risk (such as the Line 5 pipeline) and addressing failing piping infrastructure that has restricted access to clean, unleaded, uncontaminated water in communities like Flint and Detroit.
      - title: Support healthy food and land
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must address lack of access to healthy food and lands by uplifting local, healthy, and sustainable efforts to protect the land and our food sources.
      - title: Invest in clean, affordable energy
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must create and support new, clean, sustainable energy systems that do not burden local communities. Far too many Michiganders face rate hike increases by “public” utility companies that are unwilling to innovate or accept exiting technology. This must end.
      - title: Fight for disability rights
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must recognize that climate crisis driven natural disasters possess a unique risk to those who have already been overlooked. Research shows that when natural disasters strike, differently-abled individuals are at risk. From ensuring ADA compliance to ensuring all have civil rights, we must fight for disability rights.
  - summary: A GND for Detroit recognizes that Detroit’s history, culture, economic and social environment provides unique opportunity, and unique challenges, to local implementation of the Green New Deal.
    demands:
      - title: Stop  gentrification, keep Detroiters in their homes
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must acknowledge Detoit’s foreclosure crisis and take active steps to solve, not perpetuate Detroiters losing their homes. Communities like Detroit want and deserve to be invested in; however, we must not solve one set of crisis (climate change, restarting our manufacturing sector, etc) by perpetuating another (gentrification and driving Detroiters away from their homes). 
      - title: Should prevent industry from entering ANY backyard and address historic harm
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must protect ALL frontline communities. For far too long, communities in Michigan’s most polluted zip code (48217), in Southwest Detroit, in Dearborn, and in other areas regionally, have had to deal with the impact of industrial plants, toxic waste sites, and pollution within a close proximity to their homes. No company should be allowed to operate within close proximity of homes; we should protect frontlines by recognizing the cumulative health impacts of prolonged exposure and addressing this historic harm first.
      - title: Upflift worker power and guarantee unions for all
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must recognize and continue our historic connection to the labor movement by enshrining the right to a living wage, the right to organize, and the right to a safe workplaces free of violence and sexual harassment.
      - title: Support equitable education and worker training
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must provide adequate and equitable education opportunities for ALL students. Detroit built the middle class, in part because of a robust and adequate education system. Now, whether it’s college, apprenticeship programs or other worker programs, we must return to educating and training workers who will drive the economy of the future.
      - title: Invest in mass transit
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must recognize that while Detroit is the Motor City, we want to build the infrastructure of the future (electric vehicles, trains, etc). Addressing both climate and economic justice means that we must have access to affordable and clean mass transit.
  - summary: A GND for Detroit recognizes that we must return community control of taxes, power and resources to the people
    demands:
      - title: Should be led by, built by and owned by Detroiters
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit should be led by community-self determination, and uphold the values of community governance and oversight.  We must shift away from Michigan’s draconian emergency manager laws, address the role of money in politics, and stop voter suppression. We must give power back to local communities, democratize our government, and ensure that all Green New Deal investment is locally approved and guided.
      - title: Invest in communities, not mass incarceration
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must recognize the systematic oppression, including police and prison violence, that far too many Detroiters face. The state of Michigan spends nearly $2 billion, nearly 20% of our state budget general fund, on prisons. We must invest in frontline communities not mass incarceration.
      - title: Invest in communities, not warmongers
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must prioritize frontline communities in the US, not the pockets of those who profit from war. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost taxpayers over $2 trillion and thousands of lives, all while our communities have dealt with systematic disinvestment. We need to end endless wars and invest in communities, all while addressing the world's biggest national security threat - climate change.
      - title: Support community, not corporate welfare
        details: A Green New Deal for Detroit must make investments in local communities, co ops and other types of local small businesses, not publicly funded stadiums and bailouts. It’s our tax money, it should be invested in our community.
