      Communities on the frontlines of poverty, pollution, and climate change
      are uniting to make Detroit the Engine of the Green New Deal!


      Detroit needs what people need everywhere - good, clean, local, union
      jobs, affordable and clean water, clean air, and a livable future for all
      of us and our loved ones to thrive. We need to build a fair, green economy
      that serves the needs of people and planet. We need to deepen, broaden and
      strengthen our democracy and people power. 


      The people of Detroit are ready to build this better future together. We
      will rally at Cass Park before marching to the Fox Theater, where we will
      raise our voices loud enough for the political and media establishment to
      hear us.

      48217 is the most contaminated zip code in Michigan. Marathon Oil and
      other corporate polluters are violating residents' human right to clean
      air and water, while politicians look the other way. __Residents invite
      all presidential candidates to visit 48217__ to breathe our air and see
      the real impacts of environmental racism. We need a Green New Deal for
      48217, and we need the candidates to follow the leadership of all
      frontline communities!
